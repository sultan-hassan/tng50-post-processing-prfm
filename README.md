# ISM property maps Data Release from TNG50

This repository contains all local ISM property maps generated from TNG50 simulations (https://www.tng-project.org/) to generate predictions in post-processing for the Pressure-Regulated, Feedback-Modulated Star Formation Model (PRFM), see Ostriker & Kim, https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00681. For the full description of the equations/methods/implementation guide, please see Hassan+2024. 

# Repository Structure
  - **generate_ism_maps.py** Fast post-processing code using multiprocessing to generate various ISM property maps of average/midplane and projected densities within 1 kpc $\times$ 1 kpc columns of all selected galaxies from TNG50.
